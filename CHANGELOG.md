# Changelog

All notable changes to Hydra are documented here. This project follows
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org).

## v3.13.7 — 2026-07-30

### Changed
- Incognito now also masks peer IPs in the torrent detail peers tables and the race progress graph legend.

## v3.13.6 — 2026-07-30

### Changed
- In incognito, the exit IP (header + agents) is now shown as an obviously-redacted mask instead of a realistic fake IP, so it cannot be mistaken for a real address. Peer IPs stay distinct placeholders.

## v3.13.5 — 2026-07-30

### Changed
- Incognito now also masks category names in the Categories tab, the category filter chips and category dropdowns (display only; editing/filtering still use the real names).

## v3.13.4 — 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- Removed the border box around the Incognito header icon (now a plain white icon).

## v3.13.3 — 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- Incognito header icon is now white so it is visible on the dark header.

## v3.13.2 — 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- The index page is served with `Cache-Control: no-cache` so UI updates show up without a manual hard-refresh. Made the Incognito header button clearly visible (bordered icon).

## v3.13.1 — 2026-07-30

### Changed
- Moved the Incognito toggle out of the tab bar into a small icon button in the header (next to the health dot), so it no longer looks like a navigation tab.

## v3.13.0 — 2026-07-30

### Changed
- Saving settings no longer always demands a full restart. Changes are now tiered: the peer **listen port** is applied **live** (no restart at all); engine knobs and daemon/auth settings show an accurate "restart" prompt instead of a blanket one. (Live engine-only restart for engine knobs is coming next.)

## v3.12.0 — 2026-07-30

### Added
- **Incognito mode** — a toggle next to "Add Torrent" that anonymizes the UI for screenshots and screen-sharing: torrent names become Linux ISOs, categories become distro names, and every IP (peers, tunnels, exit IP, agents) is replaced with a reserved documentation IP. Display-only and deterministic (stable labels); your real data, filters and actions are untouched. Remembered in the browser.

## v3.11.3 — 2026-07-30

### Changed
- Reworked which settings are shown by default vs behind "Show advanced" in the Configuration tab, aligned with qBittorrent's everyday options: per-engine listen port, bind interface, connection limits, upload rate and queueing (active downloads/seeds/torrents) plus WebUI/auth are now front-and-center; proxy/SOCKS, PROXY-v2, choking internals, timeouts and tuning knobs move to advanced. Also dropped stale references to removed settings.

## v3.11.2 — 2026-07-30

### Added
- The `bind_interface` setting in the Configuration tab is now a **dropdown of detected interfaces** (name — IP), not a free-text field.

### Fixed
- Existing installs now automatically gain newly-added config keys (currently `bind_interface`/`listen_interfaces`) on the next start — they are appended to `default.toml` additively (existing lines untouched) so the options appear in the Configuration editor without a manual edit.

## v3.11.1 — 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- `bind_interface` and `listen_interfaces` now ship (empty) in the default `[race]`/`[hoard]` config, so they show up as editable fields in the Configuration tab instead of being invisible until hand-added.

## v3.11.0 — 2026-07-30

### Added
- **Exit IP in the header** — the daemon's public egress IP is shown top-right next to the health dot, so you can confirm at a glance that traffic leaves through your VPN.
- **Agents show their exit IP and interfaces** — the Agents tab has an Exit IP column (each agent reports its own egress, i.e. its own tunnel), and hovering it lists that agent's network interfaces. Backed by a new node-level `node_info` agent call.

## v3.10.0 — 2026-07-30

### Added
- **Interface binding made easy**: the Configuration tab now lists the host's network interfaces (name + IP), and a new `bind_interface` setting under `[race]`/`[hoard]` pins an engine to an interface by **name** (e.g. `wg0`). The name is resolved to its current IP at engine start, so it keeps working across VPN reconnects where the tunnel IP rotates. Explicit `listen_interfaces` (IP-based) still wins when set.

## v3.9.1 — 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- The **Configuration** tab no longer returns a 500 when the config file lives outside `data_dir` (e.g. the bare-metal install: config in `/etc/hydra`, data in `/var/lib/hydra`). The settings editor now reads and writes the actual `--config` file the daemon loaded instead of assuming `<data_dir>/default.toml`.

## v3.9.0 — 2026-07-30

### Changed
- **qBittorrent import is now pipelined** — a small pool of fetchers pulls `.torrent` files from qBittorrent while a larger pool adds them to the engine concurrently, instead of one torrent at a time. Large libraries import several times faster; the fetch concurrency is kept low so qBittorrent's WebUI stays responsive.

### Fixed
- The import now carries over the **all-time upload AND download** totals into Hydra's baseline, so the overview ratio/totals reflect your migrated history (previously only a cosmetic line; download was not read at all).
- Imported torrents keep their **original add date** from qBittorrent instead of showing the moment of import.

## v3.8.0 — 2026-07-30

### Added
- **Bare-metal install**: tagged releases now ship a self-contained Linux tarball (`hydra-vX.Y.Z-linux-{amd64,arm64}.tar.gz`) with the `hydra` and `hydra-engine` binaries, a sample config, a systemd unit, and an `install.sh`. `sudo ./install.sh` drops everything under `/opt/hydra` + `/etc/hydra` + `/var/lib/hydra`, creates a `hydra` user, and enables the service (starts on boot, restarts on failure). No Docker required.
- The engine binary path is now resolved via `HYDRA_ENGINE_BIN`, then next to the `hydra` binary, then the Docker default — so the two binaries can live anywhere together.

### Changed
- Web UI assets (templates + static + changelog) are now **embedded in the binary**. Hydra no longer depends on a `web/` directory next to its working directory, and the changelog is served from `/changelog.md`.

## v3.7.0 — 2026-07-30

### Added
- **Agent listen-port hook** (`--listen-port-hook <port>`, opt-in): an `--agent-only` node can now serve a loopback-only (`127.0.0.1`) `POST /listen-port` endpoint so a gluetun sidecar sharing its network namespace can push the VPN's forwarded port via a plain `wget` — the piece that was missing to run the one-agent-per-engine-behind-its-own-VPN topology. Bound to loopback in hard code (never reachable off the shared netns or over the tunnel); honors `--agent-token` via the `X-API-Key` header when set.

## v3.6.3 — 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- A freshly-added torrent now shows its **category** immediately instead of appearing under "none" until the next stats refresh (the category was stored correctly but not projected into the live list on add / recheck-to-seeding).

## v3.6.2 — 2026-07-30

### Added
- Torrent **progress** now streams live in the list — no refresh needed.

### Fixed
- Changing a torrent's **category** updates the row immediately instead of only after a refresh.
- The qBittorrent import counts already-present torrents as **skipped** rather than failed.
- The update-availability check no longer polls every second (throttled on the client; the server already caches it).
- The Add form no longer breaks when no engine mode is active (falls back to race).

## v3.6.1 — 2026-07-30

### Added
- **Import** is now a sub-tab of the Config tab — re-run the qBittorrent import any time, not just at the one-time first-run prompt.

### Fixed
- The qBittorrent import wizard "Skip" button is now styled (was an unstyled white button).

## v3.6.0 — 2026-07-29

### Added
- **Choose visible columns** — right-click a table header (Race or Hoard) to show/hide columns; remembered per table.
- **Changelog tab** — this page, rendered in-app from the repository CHANGELOG.
- **Update badge** — a small badge appears next to the version when a newer release exists. Checked server-side against GitHub (cached 6h, no browser CORS); opt out with .

## v3.5.0 — 2026-07-29

### Added
- **Column visibility** — right-click a table header (Race or Hoard) to pick which columns to show. Remembered per table.
- **Display units** — choose size units (binary `MiB` vs decimal `MB`) and speed units (bytes `MB/s` vs bits `Mbps`) in the Config tab; applied to every size/speed readout.
- **Change category without moving files** — right-clicking a hoard torrent now offers both `Change category` (re-tag only) and `Change category + move files`.

### Fixed
- The **Agents** tab now loads its data when you open it, not only when arriving via the `#agents` URL.

## v3.4.0 — 2026-07-29

### Added
- **Reworked Add form** — the category is the primary field and drives the mode + save path; mode/save-path move under an Advanced section. Clear confirmation on add.
- **Persistent table sort** — the column and direction you sort by are remembered across reloads, per table.
- **Config sub-tabs** — the settings menu is split into per-domain tabs instead of one long scroll.

### Fixed
- **No more re-downloading already-complete data** on a re-add: a recheck is no longer interrupted by the download slot manager (it used to pull 100–200 MB before finishing).
- **Torrent name shows immediately** in the list after adding — it previously appeared as the info-hash until a refresh (or two).
- **Category routing** — picking a category now routes to its engine role, instead of falling back to `race`.
- Fixed the category auto-fill in the Add form.

## v3.3.0 — 2026-07-29

### Added
- **Recheck** — adding a torrent whose data is already on disk now hash-checks it and seeds the valid pieces instead of blindly re-downloading over them. Missing/corrupt pieces are fetched; a complete torrent goes straight to seeding.
  - Available as the qBittorrent `POST /api/v2/torrents/recheck` and the native `POST /api/hoard/torrents/<hash>/verify` (hoard engine only).
  - `skip_checking=true` stays the trust-fast path for cross-seed / hardlinked data.
