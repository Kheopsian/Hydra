// pinDialerToInterface makes every socket a dialer opens leave by ONE named
// interface, and returns the error that must fail the dial when it cannot.
//
// It pins by NAME (SO_BINDTODEVICE), not by source address, because a source
// address does not choose a route. ProtonVPN hands every tunnel the same
// 10.2.0.2, so a source-IP bind cannot tell wg0 from wg1 and the kernel routes
// both by destination, out whichever tunnel holds the default route.
//
// Measured on two Proton tunnels (FR#173 and FR#373) in a dedicated netns:
//
//	source-IP bind    wg0 -> 146.70.194.118   wg1 -> 146.70.194.118   (same, wrong)
//	SO_BINDTODEVICE   wg0 -> 146.70.194.118   wg1 -> 79.127.169.78    (right)
//
// So every engine of a multi-tunnel setup was announcing through one tunnel,
// with no error and no log, while the header showed one exit address for all of
// them. That is exactly the leak bind_interface exists to close, and it was not
// closed: the pin was real but powerless.
//
// The source address is still pinned when the interface carries an IPv4, both
// because it is the correct source for that device and because the announce
// path reads a pinned binding as IPv4-only.
